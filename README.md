# Parking-Management-System
Rwanda  is highly developing in all sectors. Infrastructural development is rapidly improving which favors various companies to operate in the new and old buildings, which will have to provide parking space. Parking Management System will ensure access to free parking lots in the buildings across the city by specifying your exact destination. This will include the specific time duration to be spent in the reserved parking space rather than circulating for hours to find a free space to park in.
